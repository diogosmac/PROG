#### FEUP - MIEIC - 1st Year - 2nd Semester - [Programming | Programação (PROG)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883)

Final project for the semester - Crosswords Creator and Player

### Project Description
#### Crosswords Creator
As one would expect, the first program allows the user to create a customized Crosswords puzzle.
Starting off, the program gives the user 2 options:
  - Creating a new one, starting from scratch;
  - Continuing the creation of a previously started puzzle;
The program gives the user instructions on how to use it, as the user moves along the creation of the puzzle, meaning the program can be used by anyone.
All necessary files are contained in the folder for this program.

#### Crosswords Player
The second program allows the user to **solve** one of the puzzles created by the first program.
The player will receive hints, in the form of synonyms, to the words they have to guess. As with the first program, in-depth instructions are given to the user, as they go along.
Manage to beat the puzzle, and your name will be recorded in the **Score file**!
